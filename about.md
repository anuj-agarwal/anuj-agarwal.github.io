  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Anuj Agarwal</strong>, a Generative AI & Machine Learning Leader with over 9 years of experience across <strong>Finance, Healthcare, and Cybersecurity</strong>. I love building AI solutions that solve real-world problems and scale across industries.</p>

  <p>My journey started at <strong>NIT Silchar</strong> with a degree in Electronics & Communications, where I built a strong foundation in engineering, algorithms, and data-driven problem solving. I then progressed through diverse roles, from technology consulting and AI research to leading enterprise AI adoption at KPMG.</p>

  <p>Along the way, I have delivered projects that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <strong>Generative AI and LLMs</strong> to automate and optimize business processes.</li>
    <li>Leverage <strong>Computer Vision</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong> to enhance healthcare diagnostics.</li>
    <li>Implement <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation</strong> and <strong>Semantic NLP pipelines</strong> for knowledge extraction and automation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Outside work, I enjoy exploring new AI tools, mentoring teams, and publishing research. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and delivering solutions that have meaningful impact.</p>
